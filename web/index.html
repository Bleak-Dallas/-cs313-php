      <h2>The 82nd Airborne Division</h2>
      <p>The 82nd Airborne Division is an elite airborne infantry division of 
      the United States Army, specializing in parachute assault operations into 
      denied areas. Based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 82nd Airborne 
      Division is part of the XVIII Airborne Corps. The 82nd Airborne Division is 
      the U.S. Army's most strategically mobile division. Some sources consider 
      the 82nd Airborne Division the most highly trained light infantry division 
      in the world.</p>

      <p>I was fortunate to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division for 10 years. It was some of the best years of my life. I learned great lessons about teamwork and trust while serving with some great men.</p>
